# Gorilla DataFrame Library - Complete TODO List

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all remaining tasks to complete the high-performance concurrent DataFrame library.

## üö® Critical Priority (Performance Blockers)

### 1. ~~Parallel LazyFrame.Collect() Implementation~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented in `dataframe/lazy.go`

**Implementation Details**:
- Parallel execution automatically activates for DataFrames with 1000+ rows
- Uses adaptive chunking based on CPU count and data size
- Implemented with thread-safe memory management for Arrow arrays
- Falls back to sequential execution for small datasets
- Includes comprehensive tests and benchmarks

**Key Features**:
- `collectParallel()` method handles concurrent processing
- Worker pool from `internal/parallel` package manages goroutines
- Independent data copies ensure thread safety
- Fan-out/fan-in pattern for efficient result aggregation

## üî• High Priority (Core Features)

### 2. Query Optimization Engine

- **Predicate Pushdown**: Move filter operations early in pipeline
- **Projection Pushdown**: Only process columns needed by final result  
- **Operation Fusion**: Combine multiple operations into single pass

### 3. Essential Data Operations

- **GroupBy** with parallel aggregation
- **Join** operations (inner, left, right, full outer)
- **Sorting** with parallel merge sort

### 4. Type System Expansion

- Mixed arithmetic type coercion (int32/int64, float32/float64)
- Date/time/timestamp types with timezone support
- Decimal/money types for financial calculations

---

## üìä Medium Priority (Advanced Features)

### 5. I/O Operations

- CSV reader/writer with parallel parsing
- Parquet file format support  
- Database connectivity (SQL execution)
- Streaming data ingestion

### 6. Memory Management

- Streaming processing for datasets larger than memory
- Memory usage monitoring and automatic spilling
- Memory pool management for Arrow arrays

### 7. Advanced Analytics

- Statistical functions (correlation, regression)
- Time series operations (resampling, rolling windows)
- Window functions (row_number, rank, lag/lead)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Low Priority (Polish & UX)

### 8. Developer Experience

- DataFrame visualization for debugging
- Data profiling and quality checks
- Schema validation and type inference
- SQL-like query interface

### 9. Performance Optimizations

- Dynamic worker pool scaling
- CPU affinity and NUMA-aware allocation
- SIMD vectorized operations
- GPU acceleration support

## üìÅ Detailed TODO Files

For comprehensive task lists in each component:

- **DataFrame**: `dataframe/TODO.md` - 25+ tasks
- **Expression System**: `expr/TODO.md` - 15+ tasks  
- **Parallel Processing**: `internal/parallel/TODO.md` - 12+ tasks
- **Series Operations**: `series/TODO.md` - 18+ tasks

---

## üéØ Next Recommended Steps

1. ~~**Start with Critical**: Implement parallel `LazyFrame.Collect()`~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
2. **Add GroupBy**: Essential for data analysis workflows - **NOW HIGHEST PRIORITY**
3. **Implement Joins**: Required for multi-table operations
4. **Optimize Memory**: Add chunking and streaming support

## üîç Searching for TODOs

Use these commands to find all TODOs in the codebase:

```bash
# Find all TODO comments in code
grep -r "TODO:" ./

# Find all TODO markdown files  
find . -name "TODO.md"

# Search for specific TODO topics
grep -r "parallel\|optimization\|GroupBy" internal/*/TODO.md
```

This approach provides much better searchability and organization of remaining work!
